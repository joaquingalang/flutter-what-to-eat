# Flutter What To Eat App üçï

A simple Flutter app for deciding what to eat and serves as a challenge for a mobile development workshop led by Google Developer Groups on Campus - Holy Angel University. 

After the code-along activity where the participants are taught how to create a [Dice App](https://github.com/joaquingalang/flutter-dice-app), they must apply the same concepts in order to accomplish this activity. This demonstrates the participant's proficiency and understanding of fundamental Flutter Widgets, Buttons, and using the dart:math package to generate random numbers.
